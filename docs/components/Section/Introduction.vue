    <a href="https://formkit.com/">FormKitâ€™s</a> Drag and Drop is a simple and
    easy to use JavaScript library for enabling end-users to sort an array of
    values or to transfer values from one array to another by using native drag
    and drop methods. Unlike most comparable packages, Drag and Drop does not
    perform any direct DOM manipulations to do so. Instead, it takes a
    declarative approach by updating state and allowing the reactive framework
    (of your choosing) to handle the rest.
