# Drag and Drop

# Introduction

Drag and Drop is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to sort values within a given list or transfer values from one list to another. FormKit Drag and Drop differs from other drag and drop libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable">SortableJS</a> in that it performs no DOM manipulation to move one element to another. Instead, it relies on the reactive values passed to it, and updates the values based on events from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">HTML5 Drag and Drop API</a>.
